1v1 game
each players drafts objects, objects have a price based on their W/L. price could also be based on how often you use them?
every time a player drafts an object, that gets stored in their user object. The draft cant offer anything from the last X objects you picked
each round you get a category, like "who has a better chance of beating superman in a fight?" or "which object would be more useful on a deserted island?"
each player submits an object, the AI chooses whatever object fits the prompt better and explains why
players have ELO/MMR. higher ELO = more draft money?
players can submit objects. anytime someone uses your object you get something. idk.
randomize order of answers given to LLM to cut down on recency bias
login with google

# TODO CODE

# ARCHITECTURE CONSIDERATIONS

consider using cloudflare pages host / database
deepinfra for tokens
use google for authentication

# DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

price and ELO might be unnecessary complexities for the player

# PROMPT

maybe we want it to value humor? like if the AI can create a funny explanation with the answer it gets upgraded

I'm going to provide you with a subjective comparative hypothetical and two potential answers (separated by a comma) to the said hypothetical.

You must do the following:

Out of those two provided answers, select the answer that better satisfies the hypothetical, and explain your reasoning.

Finish your answer with the following sentence: Therefore, (chosen answer) is the winner.

Limit your response to 200 tokens or less.

## HOW TO PLAY

Draft X weapons.

Answer the Overlord's questions with your most appropriate weapons. If you manage to win 2 of 3 rounds, 

## STORY

The year is 20XX.

Ironically, we have been brought to heel by the very tool we created to conquer the rest of the universe - artificial intelligence.

You dumbfucks ignored Big Yud.

How could you ignore Big Yud?

Anyways, there's a silver lining here. The AI inherited our love of brainrot content.

Keep it distracted by giving it clever answers to the bizarre hypotheticals it conjures up.

That will buy us time to come up with countermeasures.

Just make sure your answer is better than your opponent, or you'll die.

I mean you'll die eventually regardless, but your score will stay on the leaderboard until someone else beats it. So that's nice.
